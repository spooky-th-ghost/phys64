For Tomorrow:
* Skid to a stop, take a fraction of current momentum and add it as a very short force
* pivots, use the same logic as pivots, with a different animation
* long jump
* slopes


Wed 20 Dec 2023 03:15:49 PM EST
* Skid complete, movement feeling much better
* Don't worry about pivots for now
* Later tonight work on longjump, slopes, and update the camera
